Welcome to salpyter's documentation!
====================================

salpyter is a python package designed to facilitate Bayesian inference of IMF parameters from sample data. It includes numerical implementations for the functional forms of some standard IMFs, routines for generating samples from those IMFs, and -- most notably -- routines for obtaining Monte Carlo samples from the Bayesian posterior distribution of their parameters, enabling parameter inference.
